# Description 

**Rapid Energy modeling Tool_v1**

The Simple Box Excel Energy Model takes user inputs and Typical Meteorological Year (TYM) data and displays annual energy use metrics for specified end uses. The user must select the climate zone and building characteristics of interest. We have provided T-24 (Title 24 - 2019 - SpaceBySpace.xlsx) and ASHRAE (ASHRAE Standard 901G_2010.xlsx) space type standards as a reference. The Rapid Energy Modeling Tool has predefined hourly useage schedules (cells C17:F40) that can also be changed based on the space type or user experience.
